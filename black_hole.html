    <h1>The Black Hole</h1>
    <p>As you approach the black hole, the strong gravity pulls your ship. After orbiting around and collecting data, you decide to 
        get a closer look. You hop into your space suit and decide to fly towards it alone; whats the worst that can happen? It begins to 
        pull you in closer and closer and the gravity gets stronger. You decide to go back but it's too late, you've passed the event horizon.  
        This is the area around a black hole where the gravity is so strong, not even light can escape. To your crew, you look as if you are frozen but, this 
        is not the case for you. Because of the exponential increase in gravity, the gravity on your feet is greater than the gravity on your head. 
        this causes you to be stretched. aka Spaghettification. You are lost to the black hole.
