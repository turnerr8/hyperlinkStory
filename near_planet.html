    <h1>Nearest Habitable Planet</h1>
    <p>
        You've made it. The closest planet to Earth that has similar conditions was only 4.246 light years away. This planet, Proxima b, 
        may just have life, time to check it out! Sure enough, as you go to land, you see a figure with his back towards you, YOU DID IT!
        You leave the ship and hold up your hands to the little green man. He turns around and is wearing a barstool sports shirt with a snapback 
        and a gold chain and asks you to follow his sound cloud. You found life, but at what cost.
